**Disclaimers**

I decided to choose a different figma design as because the design given in the task description is only an image whereas I needed a figma, sketch or psd design and also in the task it was clearly mentioned in the task is `Please use your own design or template (no specific asset, feel free to use any that relates)`. Below is the link to figma design I choose for this task.

## Technological Stack

1. Nextjs
2. Reactjs
3. husky
4. commitlint
5. Typescript
6. Atomic Design Principle

Styles contains all of the global styles and variables such as `palettes`, `typography`, `gutters` i.e. `spacing` & `gaps` & `vars` etc. I decided this approach to make it developer friendly & leave less amount of technical debt.
